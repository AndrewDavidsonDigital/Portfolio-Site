        'Another more niche problem was one where you have a table cell with multiple paragraphs within it, but can only show the first X lines. Simple right? just line-clamp to X lines. The complexity here is more around how can we add a hover effect / title popover to display the content that was truncated off. Once again simple right? just set the parent wrapper for the `<p>` tag collection to be the join of all `<p>` tag contents with `\n\r` separators as the glue. Ok maybe getting a little more convoluted but still relatively simple. The kicker here is that this hover need to NOT have any paragraph copy that was wholly displayed within the cell. I called BS on the design requirement at this stage, but still wanted to know if it even was achievable. Turns out it is, but is damn computationally costly.',
        'Firstly you need to consider the font-face char-constant which is the given average, of the number of chars over all chars relative to their commonality / occurrence in the langue, which would be rendered in one font-size element. This would then be used to divide the cell width to get the average number of chars to fill out one line completely. From this its just a matter of scaling to number of lines we are clamping at, less some amount of chars to consider for word-wrapping since you almost never will have a full line.',
